# Weather App JS

Frotend web application that gives information about the current weather of a city, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

To elaborate it I used Javascript concepts like Arrow functions, async/await, constants, classes and more. Also the programming paradigm 
used was object oriented programming, plus the use of Frontend tools like webpack, Bootstrap and the use of the HTML5 LocalStorage API.
